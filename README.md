# World Layoff Data Exploratory Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is inspired by Alex the Analyst's YouTube series on data analysis. It focuses on exploring and analyzing worldwide layoff data to uncover trends and insights. The dataset includes information such as company name, location, industry, total laid off, percentage laid off, date of layoffs, company stage, country, and funds raised.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Alex the Analyst's project. It has been cleaned and standardized to ensure accuracy and consistency in the analysis.

## Objectives
- **Industry Analysis**: Identify which sectors are most affected by layoffs.
- **Temporal Trends**: Analyze how layoffs fluctuate over time (monthly, quarterly, yearly).
- **Geographic Distribution**: Determine where layoffs are concentrated geographically.
- **Company Size & Funding**: Explore the relationship between company size/funding and layoffs.
- **Economic Indicators**: Investigate potential correlations between economic factors and layoffs.

## Tools and Technologies
- **SQL**: For data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
- **Python**: For additional data manipulation and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting the analysis process and findings.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the raw and cleaned datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with the analysis and visualizations.
- `scripts/`: SQL and Python scripts used for data cleaning and analysis.
- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Using SQL to clean and standardize the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting EDA to uncover trends and insights.
3. **Visualization**: Creating visualizations to represent the findings.
4. **Reporting**: Summarizing the key insights and conclusions.

## Key Findings
- **Industry Impact**: Certain industries, such as technology and retail, have higher layoff rates.
- **Temporal Patterns**: Layoffs tend to spike during economic downturns.
- **Geographic Trends**: Layoffs are more concentrated in specific regions.
- **Company Dynamics**: Smaller companies with less funding are more prone to layoffs.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into global layoff patterns and their implications. By leveraging SQL and Python, we can gain a deeper understanding of the factors driving layoffs and their impact on different industries and regions.
